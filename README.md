# mapping_rbnx

SLAM mapping service for [Robonix](https://github.com/syswonder/robonix). It
turns a robot's lidar / camera / odom streams into a live **2D occupancy
grid**, a **3D point cloud**, and a **SLAM-corrected pose**, published under a
fixed, engine-agnostic capability surface (`robonix/service/map/*`), and
persists named maps so a robot can re-localize across restarts.

It is a Robonix **service** package: it registers with `atlas`, discovers its
sensor inputs by capability contract (never hardcoded topics), and is brought
up by `rbnx boot`. Consumers (`scene`, `nav`) bind the contracts, not the
SLAM engine.

- Capability surface, config schema, and persistence layout: **[CAPABILITY.md](CAPABILITY.md)**.
- Provider instance configuration reference: **[config.spec](config.spec)**.

## SLAM engines (`algo`)

| algo | use | inputs |
|---|---|---|
| `rtabmap` *(default, recommended)* | sim + real; 2D/3D/RGBD, sensor-agnostic | any of lidar2d / lidar3d / rgbd (+ odom) |
| `dlio` | real-robot 3D Livox + IMU | lidar3d + imu, needs a colcon ws at `/ws/install` |
| `fastlio2` | **broken (drift)** — repro only | — |

The launch branches on the provider roles bound by the deployment, so the same
service supports 2D lidar, 3D lidar, RGB-D, and external odometry without
robot-specific branches.

## How to integrate it on your robot

1. **Register your sensors** as Robonix primitives under the standard
   contracts (`robonix/primitive/lidar/lidar3d`, `.../camera/depth`,
   `.../chassis/odom`, …). mapping discovers them via atlas.
2. **Pick a deployment target** and reference the matching package manifest
   from your deploy `robonix_manifest.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   service:
     - name: mapping
       url: https://github.com/syswonder/service-map-rbnx
       # manifest: package_manifest.jetson-native.yaml   # x86+docker is default
       config:
         sensor_providers:
           lidar3d: roof_lidar
           rgb: front_camera
           depth: front_camera
           odom: base_chassis
         occupancy_sources: [lidar]
         deskew_lidar: true
         params_file: config/rtabmap_params.yaml
         rtabmap_params:
           Grid/FootprintLength: 0.84
           Grid/FootprintWidth: 0.60
   ```
3. `rbnx build -f robonix_manifest.yaml` then `rbnx boot -f robonix_manifest.yaml`.
4. Consume the map: subscribe to `robonix/service/map/occupancy_grid` /
   `.../pointcloud` / `.../pose` (resolve them via atlas).

[`config/rtabmap_params.template.yaml`](config/rtabmap_params.template.yaml) is
only a starting template. Copy it into the robot deployment repository and set
`params_file`; Mapping never loads the upstream template at runtime. Inline
`rtabmap_params` applies after the deploy-owned file.

With external odometry, `deskew_lidar` compensates each PointCloud2 point in
the odom frame before SLAM. Bind only the sensor roles Mapping should consume.

## Deployment targets

One package, three targets (selected by the deploy `manifest:` field — see
[CAPABILITY.md](CAPABILITY.md#deployment-targets)):

| target | manifest | runtime |
|---|---|---|
| x86_64 + docker | `package_manifest.yaml` | docker (`docker/Dockerfile`) |
| arm64 Jetson + docker | `package_manifest.jetson-docker.yaml` | docker (`docker/Dockerfile.jetson`, L4T) |
| arm64 Jetson + native | `package_manifest.jetson-native.yaml` | host ROS2 (`scripts/start_native.sh`) |

Add a target by adding a `package_manifest.<target>.yaml` plus a case branch
in `scripts/build.sh` — the rest of the package is unchanged.

The generated ROS 2 overlay intentionally builds only Robonix's custom `map`
interface package. Standard interfaces such as `sensor_msgs` continue to come
from the target's ROS 2 Humble installation, preserving its support libraries
and CMake exports for consumers such as `cv_bridge`.

## Saving & re-using a map

Mapping starts with a fresh runtime database. Call `save_map(map_id)` after
coverage is complete; the named map lives under `{MAPPING_MAPS_DIR}/{map_id}/`
(default: the package's `maps/` dir, which survives container restarts):

```
maps/lab_3f/rtabmap.db  occupancy.pgm  occupancy.yaml  occupancy.png  cloud.pcd  meta.yaml
```

- **Build a map:** `map_mode: mapping`. Drive the robot around, then call
  `save_map(map_id)` to publish an immutable database and previews.
- **Re-use a map:** set `map_id` plus `map_mode: localization`. Mapping copies
  the saved db to a private runtime path and re-localizes against it; the
  **map frame is stable across restarts**, so Scene can load semantic state for
  the same id.
- **Start fresh:** `map_mode: mapping` (the default). It never writes an
  existing saved map.

> Localization-mode persistence only re-anchors correctly because the map
> frame is loaded from the saved db. Without `map_mode: localization` the
> map origin resets to the robot's boot pose each run.

## Web UI (live map + runtime map ops)

A dependency-light operator page (stdlib `http.server` + Pillow) is enabled on
port `8091` by default; set deployment config `webui_port: 0` to disable it.
It binds `127.0.0.1` by default because the map controls are unauthenticated.
An authenticated overlay deployment may explicitly set `webui_host` (or
`MAPPING_WEBUI_HOST`); otherwise use the local browser or an SSH tunnel.

It runs **inside the mapping bridge process**, so its buttons call the same
`map_ops` impls the gRPC/MCP capabilities use — no extra round trip — and it
reads the live `/map` + pose straight off the bridge's rclpy node.

- **Live map canvas** — occupancy grid + robot pose, with **drag-to-pan,
  wheel-zoom, a 1 m grid, and double-click-to-fit**. Same world-centered
  view model as scene's web UI (canvas backing-store pinned to display size,
  so click coordinates are exact).
- **Save** — snapshot the live map under a `map_id` (writes
  `rtabmap.db` + `occupancy.png/pgm/yaml` + `meta.yaml`).
- **Library** — every saved map with a thumbnail; **Load** re-localizes onto
  it, **Del** removes it from disk.
- **Mode** — flip **Mapping ⇄ Localization** at runtime; a badge + button
  highlight shows the current mode.
- **Reset map** — wipe the live SLAM session and rebuild from scratch (for
  when mapping diverges). Note: the origin resets to the robot's *current*
  pose, so the rebuilt frame won't match the old map (origin drift).
- **Click the map → pose estimate** — seeds `/initialpose` so rtabmap
  re-localizes; the **activity log** records the seeded pose and, a few
  seconds later, where it converged + the distance from your estimate.

These are the same operations exposed as runtime **RPC + MCP capabilities**
(so Pilot can drive them too): `save_map`, `load_map`, `pose_estimate`,
`switch_mode` (the webui adds `reset` + `delete` on top). All work on the
running rtabmap without a redeploy — `load`/`switch_mode` call rtabmap's
runtime services and fall back to a restart with the config's `map_mode` /
`map_id` when those services aren't reachable.

> The web UI has no auth — it's a LAN debug tool. Don't expose the port to an
> untrusted network.

## Troubleshooting

- **`/map` never populates** — a provider binding is missing or points to the
  wrong provider. Check the `[start_engine] rtabmap scan2d=… scan3d=…` line.
- **`map_mode=localization` errors "no saved map"** — run a `mapping` session
  with that `map_id` first, and confirm `MAPPING_MAPS_DIR` is the same path
  (mounted) across runs.
- **Map origin drifts between runs** — you're in `mapping` mode (origin =
  boot pose). Use `localization` to re-anchor to the saved map.
