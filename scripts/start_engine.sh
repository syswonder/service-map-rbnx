# Supported algos:
#   rtabmap   — Sensor-agnostic graph SLAM. Subscribes to whatever
#               sensors.* the deploy enabled (lidar2d / lidar3d / rgbd
#               / odom). Webots tiago = lidar2d + rgbd; real robot
#               (mid360) = lidar3d + rgbd.
#   dlio      — Direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (3D Livox; real robot)
#   fastlio2  — [BROKEN: drift] kept for repro/debug only
#
# Pre-conditions: atlas_bridge has already written
# /tmp/<algo>_resolved.yaml with discovered topic names.
