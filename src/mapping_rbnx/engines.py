"""Per-engine map operations behind one interface.

`map_ops` owns the engine-independent half of save / load / reset: the map
directory layout, the occupancy + cloud preview, metadata, atomic publish and
the lifecycle announcements. What differs per SLAM engine is only how its pose
graph is flushed to a file, how a saved graph is put back, and how a reset is
requested. Those three operations live here, one implementation per `algo`, so
adding an engine does not touch the callers.

Artifacts stay engine-tagged but the directory contract does not change: every
saved map is `{MAPPING_MAPS_DIR}/<map_id>/` with `occupancy.{pgm,yaml,png}`,
`cloud.pcd`, `meta.yaml` plus the engine's own graph file(s) — `rtabmap.db` for
RTAB-Map, `<map_id>.posegraph` + `<map_id>.data` for slam_toolbox.

        a filter publishing a corrected transform fights the frozen one and the
        robot jumps between the two answers.

        graph, it does not add to it, and it is the sole publisher of `/map` and
