"""Find where a robot is on a saved map from one stationary laser scan.

A particle filter cannot do this. Its update is driven by motion -- with the
robot still, the cloud never resamples and the estimate never sharpens -- so
relocalizing with it means driving the robot first, which on a real site means
asking someone to push it around before the map is usable.

Matching a scan against the map directly has no such requirement. The scan is
scored at every pose the map allows, coarsely and then finely, and the answer is
accepted only when one pose is clearly better than every other pose that is not
next to it. When two distant poses score alike the room genuinely looks the same
from both, and the honest response is to say so and ask for a nudge -- that is
the only case where the robot has to move at all.
