"""Map identity / lifecycle broadcast — robonix/service/map/lifecycle.

Publishes {map_id, mode, generation} (map/msg/MapLifecycle) latched
(RELIABLE + TRANSIENT_LOCAL, depth 1) so late-joining consumers — the
scene service keys its semantic object store by map_id — learn the
current map identity at startup without polling, and re-publishes on
every lifecycle transition (init / load / reset / mode switch).

`generation` is the map-frame epoch. Consumers holding map-frame
coordinates must treat a change in EITHER (map_id, generation) as
"previously stored coordinates are no longer anchored": reset_map keeps
map_id but moves the map origin, which only generation makes visible.

Bump rules (who calls what is wired in atlas_bridge.init + map_ops):
  - init/load in mapping mode      → bump   (origin re-derived per session)
  - init/load in localization mode → NO bump (stable frame — the whole point)
  - reset_map                      → bump   (origin moves to current pose)
  - switch_mode                    → NO bump (live frame unchanged at switch)
  - save_map                       → no state change (re-key semantics of
                                     "save live map under a new id" is a P3
                                     design question; do not guess here)

For a NAMED map the counter persists in {MAPS_DIR}/<map_id>/generation so
a localization round-trip across restarts keeps the same generation. An
ephemeral session (no map_id) publishes map_id="" — consumers treat that
as "no named identity" and fall back to their own binding config — with a
process-local generation.

The publisher needs the `map` interface package (rbnx-build/codegen/
ros2_idl overlay, built by scripts/build.sh, sourced by the entrypoint).
When the overlay is missing the broadcast is disabled with a loud log —
mapping itself must keep working, consumers just fall back to static
binding.
