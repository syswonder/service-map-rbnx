"""Lightweight map web UI for the mapping service.

A dependency-light (stdlib http.server + Pillow) page that lets an operator
*see* the live SLAM map and pose, and drive the runtime map operations:
  - live 2D occupancy + robot pose preview (auto-refresh)
  - Save  → save_map(map_id)
  - Library → list saved maps with thumbnails; Load → load_map(map_id, mode)
  - Pose Estimate → click the map to seed pose_estimate(x, y, theta)

Runs inside the mapping bridge process, so its buttons call the same
map_ops impls the gRPC/MCP capabilities use — no extra round trip. It reads
the live map/pose off its own dedicated rclpy node (see _ensure_subscriptions).

The Mapping bridge enables this on port 8091 by default; deployment config may
set ``webui_port: 0`` to disable it. The server binds 127.0.0.1 by default
because it exposes unauthenticated map operations; an authenticated deployment
may explicitly set MAPPING_WEBUI_HOST otherwise.
